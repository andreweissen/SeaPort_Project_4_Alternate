### Object Oriented and Concurrent Programming, SeaPort Project 4 (Alternate) ###

#### Overview ####

The four-part SeaPort Project Series served as the primary means of concept enforcement in CMSC 335, Object Oriented and Current Programming. At its most basic level, the program employs the fundamental principles of object oriented programming and multithreading concurrency to chart the movements of hypothetical ships in a set of sea ports, processing their jobs in real time with the application of included dock workers and moving the vessels about from queue to dock to harbor as their jobs are completed.

Over the course of five projects, including the four required and an alternate Project 4, the author expanded a hand-drawn GUI constructed with Swing that provides users with a comprehensive overview of the world and its contents, in addition to a number of secondary utility features. Users are permitted access to a search function for any and all objects in the world, as well as a sorting option that lists objects by a number of user-selected parameters such as weight, draft, etc. Furthermore, each of the jobs in question is interactive, with the user given the ability to suspend, cancel, or complete ongoing jobs as desired.

#### About Project 4 (Alternate) ####

This project was a variation of Project 4 that serves as an alternate approach to the topic of listing workers by skill. Whereas the official Project 4 entry places workers into specific resource pools based on the nature of their skill or occupation, this project instead eliminates that idea, instead having jobs sift through all workers in each port. Instead of a GUI wherein each skill group is displayed in its own row, this project instead displays the name, location, skill, and availability of each worker in each port, changing the color and text of certain labels depending on that individual's employment status in real time.

Included are all files, documentation (notated as `Eissen_Project4.pdf`), and the project requirements rubrics (notated as `SeaPort_Project4_Rubric.pdf`).
