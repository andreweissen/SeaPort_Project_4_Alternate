     * This method assembles workers from its <code>ArrayList</code> of <code>Person</code>s,
     * <code>this.persons</code>, that match the skills required by the <code>Job</code>s related to
     * <code>Ship</code>s moored at one of this port's <code>Dock</code>s. Those that match the
     * requirements are flagged as working and passed to the job in question for use therein.
     * <br />
     * <br />
     * Originally, in an attempt to realistically demonstrate the movement of workers from ships
     * back to the worker pool, an <code>Iterator</code> was employed to actually physically remove
     * matching workers from <code>this.persons</code> and move them into the job's
     * <code>Job.workers</code> <code>ArrayList</code>, after which time the entries were readded by
     * <code>this.returnResources</code>. This in some ways simplified the searches for needed
     * entries, as the reduced contents of <code>this.persons</code> reflected the fact that the
     * missing <code>Person</code> entries were off undertaking jobs elsewhere were thus unavailable
     * for use on other jobs.
     * <br />
     * <br />
     * However, the author considered that this method/process, though reflective of reality in some
     * ways, was particularly taxing, requiring constant <code>ArrayList</code> manipulations that
     * could be more readily achieved through the use of a <code>boolean</code> flag attached to
     * each <code>Person</code> instance, namely <code>Person.isWorking</code> Furthermore, this
     * approach was similarly employed in the pseudo-code attached to the Project 3 rubric.
     * <br />
     * <br />
     * The method accepts a reference to the <code>Job</code> invoking this method to gain easier
     * access to the assorted <code>Job</code> attributes and methods that are required for this
     * method.
     *
     * @param job <code>Job</code>, reference to the job in question for easier access to methods
     * @return candidates <code>Person</code> <code>ArrayList</code>

     * use, but this idea was abandoned when the author realized that this may result in longer wait
     * times if there are, say, three clerks. If the program is waiting for two specific clerks and
     * ignoring an available one simply because it wasn't added within this method's loop, this will
